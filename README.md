# CATGraph
A ROS-based android application developed to read and visualize ROS data from the CAT Vehicle, the self-driving car at the University of Arizona's Compositional Systems Lab.

This application was developed as a part of final project for ECE 573 Software Engineering Concepts in Fall 2016. The original application uses Android API from Android Lollipop and has not been modified to support newer release. As a result, it is not guaranteed that the application will work, as it is on newer android platforms. I will update to support newer platform whenever it is possible for me.
